    short_description: The main entry point for the gfs2 role.
    description: >
      The gfs2 role allows you to create gfs2 file systems in a pacemaker
      cluster managed using `pcs`. Before this role is invoked, the cluster
      must be set up (perhaps using the `ha_cluster` role) and fencing must be
      enabled.

      This role will install necessary packages, set up the dlm and lvmlockd
      cluster resources, create the LVM volume groups and logical volumes, and
      create the gfs2 file system and cluster resources with the necessary
      resource constraints.

      If any of the cluster resources already exist, make sure that the
      `gfs2_resource_name_*` variables are set to the names of the resources so
      that it can detect them.

      The role errs on the side of caution when creating the file system. If
      the file system does not yet exist, the first time this role runs it will
      only create the gfs2 file system on the shared logical volume if an
      existing file system signature is not detected. You may need to use
      `wipefs` on the block device before continuing.
      
      On subsequent plays, if a file system signature is found then the role
      will fail unless the UUID of the previously created file system has been
      added to the `gfs2_managed_uuids` list and the file system name matches
      one of the gfs2 file systems specified in `gfs2_file_systems`.
    options:

          file systems not matching these UUIDs are detected then the mkfs
